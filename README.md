# Object-Oriented vs. Procedural: A Profiling Insight into Java Method Usage Patterns

In contemporary software development, the extent to which Java applications
utilize object-oriented programming paradigms remains a subject of interest.
Given that some studies highlight the significant overhead of OOP, it is crucial
to examine how modern applications address this issue and determine if they tend
to shift towards procedural approach for enhanced performance. This study
evaluates the runtime behavior of 28 open source Java frameworks, with the help
of [YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com) profiler. We observed a dominant
percentage of instance methods and constructors compared to static methods. That
signifies a developerâ€™s preference for the object-oriented approach much more
frequently than the procedural approach, despite its associated drawbacks.
